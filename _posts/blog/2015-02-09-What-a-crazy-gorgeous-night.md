I actually spent almost a day to make this page.  
This was tough.. much tougher than I expected.  

So many flaws appeared during installation and initialization of jekyll, so simple theme and ruby gems.  
Perhaps It's always difficult to do something at the first step, but this time it went too much.  
So simple theme wasn't so simple enough. What a.. crazy gorgeous night..  

If normal, it's time to go to sleep.  
But this is not good enough.  
It's gonna be "a" very long day.  
Sleepless in Pangyo...
