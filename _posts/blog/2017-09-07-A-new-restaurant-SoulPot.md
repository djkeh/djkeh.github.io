Yesterday, it was around 7 and half pm after the meeting with With Innovation. I wanted to have a late supper, so I decided to wander around for a moment. It didn't take long until I found one restaurant, which actually got my attention. The "home food". hmm! That sounds interesting and healthy.

In front of the door I just took a short look at the menu stand. Strangely there wasn't so much, and there wasn't so many guests in the place. What's the lose? I got in.

And.. It was quite satisfactory.

This was my choice.

#### The meal - A bowl of rice topped with walleye pollock roe, avocado, onion and vegetables (10,000 won)

Beautiful food... I pretty much enjoyed it. Not salty, not colorful, not much, yet fresh, simeple and tasty. I'd be glad to visit here once again.
