Welcome to Uno's Blog.

This blog mainly deals with technical issues, my concerns and personal stories especially related to computer programming. Sometimes I write things in English though, Most postings here will be uploaded in Korean. If you have further questions or opinions, you're very welcome to leave comments or send emails.
